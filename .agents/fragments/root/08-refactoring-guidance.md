## Refactoring Guidance
- Baseline: `qa-refactoring` for safe, test-backed refactors.
- Stack add-on: `vercel-react-best-practices` (next.js or react stacks).
- Install command details live in `docs/skills.md`.
- Verify each micro-step with:
- `npx tsc --noEmit`
- `vitest run`
- `vite build`
- `npm run test:e2e`
- Use `vite build`, `vitest run`, and `npm run test:e2e` for deterministic single-pass verification.
- Treat `react-vite-expert` as optional specialist guidance for large structural reorganizations.
